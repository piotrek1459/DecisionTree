# Heart Disease Analysis Project

This project analyzes the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using SQLite ORM for database management and CSV Parser for reading the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient.

## Dependencies

- [SQLite ORM](https://github.com/fnc12/sqlite_orm/blob/master/README.md): A modern C++ ORM for SQLite.
- [CSV Parser](https://github.com/AriaFallah/csv-parser/blob/master/README.md): A fast, header-only, C++14 CSV parser.
